# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repo contains my project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  

The run_analysis.R script assumes that it is being run in the directory containing the unzipped "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.  

CodeBook.md details all variables used in the script, with a description, type, and units defined.

Per the assignment prompt, the output datasets contain summarized variables for each category of measurement, not the raw measurements themselves.
