# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repo contains my project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.  

The run_analysis.R script assumes that it is being run in the directory containing the unzipped "UCI HAR Dataset" directory.  

The code_book.csv details all variables used in the script, with a description, type, and units defined.

The output datasets contain descriptive variables for each measurement.
